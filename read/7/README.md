Towards Discovering the Role of Emotions in Stack Overflow

### Keywords 

- **Sentiment Analysis** - Sentiment analysis involves classifying opinions in text into categories like "positive" or "negative" often with an implicit category of "neutral".

- **Experimental Design** - Experimental design is the process of planning a study to meet specified objectives. Planning an experiment properly is very important in order to ensure that the right type of data and a sufficient sample size and power are available to answer the research questions of interest as clearly and efficiently as possible. 

- **Technical Forum (e.g. Stack Overflow)** -  A Technical forum, is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations about various technical issues/questions in the form of posted messages. These questions are often answered by members of the same community.

- **Social Factors** - The users’ status, expressed through reputation score and badges unlocked, resulted among the best predictors of success of a user.

### Notes

- **Study Instruments** - Pubic data dump from Stack Overflow was used in the study. This includes all the questions, answers, votes and tags between 2008 to 2014. This data contains:<br>
  a. 7,214,802 questions with 58% having accepted answers.<br>
  b. 12,609,623 answers and 36,923 tags.<br>

- **Commentary** - Various existing open-source and popular scripts and libraries are used in this research:
  1. Stanford CoreNLP package is used for performing sentiment analysis on sentences.
  2. Affective word classes are defined in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count taxonomy (LIWC) developed in the scope of psycholinguistic research.

- **Related work** - 
  1. Study for sentiments in Github commits performed by Guzman et al. shows evidence of correlation of negative sentiment with commit activity performed on Monday in 29 GitHub projects.
  2. Mitra and Gilbert present a study on the cognitive and affective style of communication that happen on the Kickstarter platform in order to predict the success of crowdfunding requests.
  3. Pletea et al. [19] performed a study on sentiment analysis of comments in GitHub discussion on security, assigning positive/negative/neutral scores to comments and pull requests from 90 GitHub projects.

- **Future Work** - The overall goal of our ongoing research is to investigate the role played by emotion lexicon in online Q&A websites, with a particular focus on Stack Overflow. The research is expected to help practitioners and other researchers who intend to improve emotional interface design. 


### Needs Improvement
  - Authors have not provided evidence of concrete applications of the results that will come from after the research is performed.
  - The reputation score of users in Stack Overflow evolve over time, so it's important to incorporate the growing score of users.
  - The generalizability of their findings for different technical/non-technical forums can be considered as another limitation.
