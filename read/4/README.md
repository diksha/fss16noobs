Usage patterns of collaborative tagging systems

### Keywords 

- **Tagging** - tagging is a lightweight yet very useful mechanism in helping in developers’ communication and bridging the gap between social and technical aspects [2]. It provides a simple way for annotations in which a developer could tag his artifacts so that others could search and find them. 

- **Homonymy** - Word has multiple unrelated meanings

- **Sense making** -  Sense making is the process in which information is categorized and labeled and, critically, through which meaning emerges.

- **Del.icio.us** - Is a collaborative tagging system for web bookmarks. Its creator, Joshua Schachter, calls it a 'social bookmarks manager'.

### Notes

- **Study Instruments** - Data was Delicious was analysed to uncover patterns among users, tags and URLS. The analysis was performed on two sets of Delicious data, which were retrieved between the morning of
Friday, June 23 and the morning of Monday June 27, 2005. Both of the datasets were created by first retrieving public RSS feeds and then crawling a portion of the website

- **Pattern** - The combined tags of many users’ bookmarks give rise to a stable pattern in which the proportions of each tag are nearly fixed. Empirically, usually after the first 100 or so bookmarks, each tag’s frequency is a nearly fixed proportion of the total frequency of all tags used. This stable pattern can be explained by resorting to the dynamics of a stochastic urn model originally proposed by Eggenberger and Polya to model disease contagion

- **Future Work** - This is a collaborative way of tagging. In future its expected that the sites will continue to provide fertile ground for studying computer mediated collaborative systems and these will further help in automate the process of tagging on the basis of user behaviour


### Needs Improvement

- This is a manual way of tagging. The data provided shows how the trends of a user tagging with a particular keyword increases with number of bookmarks and there is a pattern followed. 
- This pattern can therefore be used to automatically tag some context with some machine learning paradigm. There are various kinds of tags and this information can be used for categorization.
- Tags themselves vary in frequency of use, as well as in what they describe. This paper was focused on the findings from Delicious, however which might only be a case with users using delicious. Findings need to be on a more diversed platform and on diverse set of data.
